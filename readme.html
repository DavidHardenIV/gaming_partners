                <h2>Purpose For Creating This Website</h2>
                <p>I created this website to help gamers find teammates and connect with others who share their passion for video games. This is my first website, so there might be a few things to improve, but with this initial version, I truly believe it can do more than just help people find teammates—it has the potential to spark connections and even build friendships that could last a lifetime.</p>

                <h3>Quick Facts About Me</h3>
                <ul>
                    <!-- <li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Gaming, Drinking Coffee/Red Bull, and Laughing</li> -->
                    <!-- <li><strong>Current Focus:</strong> Finishing college and working as a Software Engineer Intern</li> -->
                    <li><strong>Mission:</strong> Gaming with friends is one of the most meaningful and joyful ways to connect through technology. But I know that not everyone has friends who share their love for gaming, or maybe they don't play a specific game you're passionate about. In a world that's more connected than ever, I believe no one should feel left out. You should always have the chance to find a friend, a teammate, or a kindred spirit to share the excitement of any game you love. This website is my way of making that connection possible, bringing people together through the power of gaming.</li>
